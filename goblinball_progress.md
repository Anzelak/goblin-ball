# Goblinball Development Progress

## Completed Steps

1. ✅ **Project Structure Setup**: Created the basic directory structure for the Goblinball project.
2. ✅ **Configuration System**: Implemented a flexible configuration system that loads from a JSON file and falls back to defaults.
3. ✅ **Core Data Structures**: 
   - Created the Goblin class with attributes, stats, and game functionality
   - Implemented the Team class for managing collections of goblins
   - Added the Game class to handle game state and rules
4. ✅ **Event System**: Built an event system for tracking and logging game events.
5. ✅ **Basic Visualization**: Created a Pygame-based visualization system to render the game board and goblins.

## Current Status

The project now has the basic framework in place, and we've successfully run the visualization showing:
- Two teams of goblins positioned on the game board
- Each goblin with randomized stats and names
- A visualization of the game state including carriers, knocked down goblins, and scores
- The ability to pause, toggle debug information, and select goblins

## Next Steps

1. **AI Movement System**: Implement the movement algorithms for goblins.
2. **Game Logic Implementation**: Complete the game rules and turn processing.
3. **Blocking System**: Implement the blocking and injury mechanics.
4. **Score Detection**: Add logic to detect when a goblin has scored.
5. **Game Loop**: Implement a complete game loop with turn transitions.
6. **Formation System**: Add team formations and positioning strategies.
7. **Enhanced Visualization**: Improve the visual appeal and clarity of the game.
8. **Testing and Balancing**: Test and refine the game mechanics for balance and fun.
